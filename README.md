# basic_layout_in_flutter

This project simplify  the essentials of structuring 
the elements in our app to create 
a simple layout using the Material Components.

While working with layouts in Flutter may seem a bit more clunky and verbose that on the web at first glance, it’s good to keep in mind that we also don’t have to deal with the complexity of dynamic grids or bloated media queries for every screen size. At times, layouts in Flutter may seem less powerful than the CSS you’re used to, because it really doesn’t have to be. With just a few containers, columns, rows, and spacing you can get most of the structures than you’ll ever need.
